#1.4
	What arguments can you make against the idea of a single language for all 
	programming domains?

#1.18
	Many contemporary languages allow two kinds of comments: one in which 
	delimiters are used on both ends(multiple-line comments),and one in which a 
	delimiter marks only the beginning of the comment(one-line comments). 
	Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each of these with repect to our 
	criteria.

#2.14
	What are the arguments both for and against the idea of typeless language?

#3.4
	Rewrite the BNF of Example 3.4 to add the ++ and -- unary operators of Java.

#3.7
	Using the grammar in Example 3.4, show a parse tree and a leftmost 
	derivation for each of the following statements: 

	(c)
		A = A * (B+C)

	(d) A = B * (C * (A+B))

#3.8
	Prove that following grammar is ambiguous:
	
	<S> -> <A>
	<A> -> <A> + <A> | <id>
	<id> -> a | b | c

#3.11
	Consider the following grammar:
	<S> -> <A> a <B> b
	<A> -> <A> b | b
	<B> -> b

	Which of the following sentences are in the language generated by this 
	grammar?

	a.
		babb
	b.
		bbbabb
	c.
		bbaaaaabc
	d.
		aaaaaa

#3.13
	Write a grammar for the language consisting of strings that have n copies of 
	the letter a followed by one more number of copies of the letter b, 
	where n > 0. For example, the strings abb, aaaabbbbb, and aaaaaaaabbbbbbbbb 
	are in the language but a, ab, ba, and aaabb are not.

#3.23
	Compute the weakest precondition for each of the following assignment 
	statements and postconditions:

	b.
		b = (c + 10) / 3 { b > 6 }
	c.
		a = a + 2 * b - 1 { a > 1 }


#5.6
	Consider the following JavaScript skeletal program:

	// The main program
	var x;
	function sub1() {
		var x;
		function sub2() {
			. . .
		}
	}

	function sub3() {
		. . .
	}

	Assume that the execution of this program is in the following unit order:
	main calls sub1
	sub1 calls sub2
	sub2 calls sub3

	a. Assuming static scoping, in the following, which declaration of x is 
	correct on for a reference to x?
	i. sub1
	ii. sub2
	iii. sub3
	
	b. Repeat part a, but assume dynamic scoping.

#5.8	 
	Consider the following JavaScript program:

	var x, y, z;
	fucntion sub1(){
		var a, y, z;
		function sub2(){
			var a,b,z;
			. . .
		}
		. . .
	}

	function sub3() {
		var a, x, w;
		. . .
	}

	List all the variables, along with the program units where they are 
	declared, that are visible in the bodies of sub1,sub2,and sub3,assuming 
	static scoping is used.
